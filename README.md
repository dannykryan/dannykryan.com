## Introduction

This basic portfolio website uses React, Next and Talwind and was created to get more practice with those technologies. It also has a practical use as a place to showcase my projects on the web - in a little more of a user-friendly format than Github allows!

I expect to be updating this webiste regularly so you can expect this repo to change often.

It includes some simple animations which rely on the following packages:

- [Animate on Scroll Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aos)
- [Framer Motion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/framer-motion)
